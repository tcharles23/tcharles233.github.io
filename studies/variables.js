/*
 * VARIABLES:
 *
 * 0. To hold things in memory during the life-cycle of a program, we can use variables.  Variables
 * are named identifiers that can point to values of a particular type, like a Number, String,
 * Boolean, Array, Object or another data-type.  Variables are called so because once created, we
 * can CHANGE the value (and type of value) to which they point.
 *
 * 1. To create a variable we use the keyword, var, followed by a name (id or alias) for our
 * variable.
 *
 * 2. There are 2 phases of using variables: declaration and initialization (or assignment).
 */


// 1. declaration //

var myName;


/*
 * At the declaration phase, the variable myName is undefined because we have NOT initialized it to anything
 */

console.log(myName); // prints => undefined

// 2. initialization or assignment //

myName = 'john';
console.log(myName); // prints => john

// 3. re-assignment //

myName = 'bob';

console.log(myName); // prints => bob
// NOTE: We can assign and re-assign anything to a variable with the var keyword  - we cannot do this with constants //

var myVariable = 1;

myVariable = true;


myVariable = "someString";

console.log(myVariable); // prints "something"


/* We can also declare variables with var, let, and const. You uses the key words
"var", "let", or "const". 
*/


/* var is a global variable. you can reassigned it at anytime. The variable and its name 
* will always be read by the computer first then whats assigned to it will get read. 
*/

var name = "titus";

name = "Tj"; // I reassigned name to Tj

console.log(name); // prints TJ


// let is local scope variable. You can use it like var. its blocked scope

let favFood = "pizza";

favFood = "chicken wings";

console.log(favFood); // prints chicken wings  

// const is block scope variable. You cant reassigned it. its blocked scope

const message = "Hey my name is";

console.log(message); // prints Hey my name is. 

message = "slim shady";

console.log(message); // typeError: assignment to constant variable

/* Hoisting is what will the computer read first before it excutes your code. 

Before the statements of a program are executed all var and function declaractions are hoisted to the top.

Because of this, var values will not throw a ReferenceErrors if you try referencing them before they are declared

*/

console.log(name); // prints undefined

 var newName = "phil"; 
 console.log(newName); // prints phil

 /* let and const values are not hoisted and therefore if you referencing them before they are declared 
 you will get a ReferenceError.
 */
 console.log(fruit); // prints ReferenceError

 console.log(F); // prints RefereneceError

 let fruit = "strawberries";
 let F = "fun";
 console.log(fruit); // prints strawberries
 console.log(F); // prints fun
