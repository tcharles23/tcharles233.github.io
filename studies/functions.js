/* FUNCTIONS
*
* 0. Functions: allow us to create of block and we can use it any many times we want
*
*
* 1. First we must define the function meaning giving your function something to do and 
* give it a specific code to excute

* 2. Function parameters are placeholders for the arguments thats going to be passed to the function.
* - Function arguments takes place of the parameters when passing into a function.
*
* 3. The syntax for a name function: keyword function | name of the function with parenthesis then curly braces

function person(nickname, favPlace) {

};
*
* 4. You assign a variable to a function by making a variable with name then
* use the assignment operator to assign it to the function.

let movies = function() {
    
};
*
* 5. Functions can control its inputs but how many arguments it takes in. 
* - we specify outputs by the return statement inside of the function body
*
* 6. Functions can see and modify variables in the parent scope not the global scope
*
*
* 7. Closures: is where the inner function can access the outer function variables
*
*
* 8. Scope: refers to what variables are accessible and where we can access them. 
*  Global scope - anything outside the function scope
*  Local scope - anthing inside the function body
*
* Functions hold their variables in a scope to protect them from thier protect scope.
* Child scope can access the variables of it's parent scope plus global scope but the parent scope doesnt
* have access to the child scope.
*

// named function: a function that is named 
function movie(title, year) {
    return title + ' ' + year;
}
movie('US', '2019');

// function expression: 
// we make a function expression by assigning a function to a variable
let realName = function(firstName, lastName) {

    return firstName + ' ' + lastName;
}

//Functions can see and modify variables in the global scope 
// example 
let name = "titus";
function newName() {
name = "phil";
} 
// console.log(name);// prints titus

newName();// to access phil I have to call the function then check for name
console.log(name); // prints phil
